How it works:
on_press function: Writes the key pressed to key_log.txt. Special keys are recorded differently.
on_release function: Stops the listener if the Escape key (esc) is pressed.
keyboard.Listener: Listens for keyboard events and triggers the on_press and on_release functions.


Usage:
Run the script, and it will start logging keystrokes to key_log.txt. Press Esc to stop the keylogger.

Disclaimer: 
Use this script responsibly and only with permission. Unauthorized keylogging is illegal and unethical.

for Usage:

pip install pynput
